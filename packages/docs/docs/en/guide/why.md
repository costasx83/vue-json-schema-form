# Why Developed

* There were no projects based on elementUi and Vue that could meet the requirements and were being maintained...

* The project needed it, so I temporarily wrote a version that only supports plain objects

* After looking at the implementation of [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form), I decided to gradually improve it, and then it became like this...
